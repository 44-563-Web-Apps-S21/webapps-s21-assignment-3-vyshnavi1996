        <h2>MOVIES</h2>
        <P>If you thought that the only movies that are good for us are those educational
           foreign films or black and white documentaries, you’d be wrong. Although these 
           movies may be good for our minds, it turns out that comedies are good for our hearts. 
           When we watch a movie that makes us laugh our blood vessels expand, which helps improve our 
           blood flow. The lead researcher, Dr Michael Miller, said that watching a comedy was as good 
           for your heart as doing ‘a bout of aerobic exercise’.
